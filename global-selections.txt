My key learning points:
1) Our actions should be guided by what is right - and not by herd mentality. It is easy to go along with social norms and it can be very difficult to take action or speak up against injustice. In that regard, Michael Lewis' decision to speak truth to the inconsistencies of Wall Street is a great reminder to constantly recalibrate our moral compass and be guided by it.

2) To build software, programmers need to follow the syntax of programming languages. To effect change in governance, we will need to similarly follow the syntax of policymaking (i.e. policy and legal procedures and protocols). Otherwise, we are setting ourselves up for errors and pushback. Aaron Swartz is an extreme example of it.

3) Actions speak louder than words. I didn't agree with the approach of Arundhati Roy's article because I am doubtful that her extended discussion on inequality and injustice (with dubiously anecdotal and non-empirical examples) had any impact on the very issues that she discussed. Yes, people probably read the article and felt a surge of anger against the establishment. And then what? Having had some experience in public policy myself, I've seen positive public policy outcomes come from (i) consistent policy implementation and regular re-assessments (it's hard to go into details in less than 100 words!), (ii) innovative solutions offered by the private sector, and (iii) accountable and transparent governments, but very rarely from a long essay published in a magazine.
